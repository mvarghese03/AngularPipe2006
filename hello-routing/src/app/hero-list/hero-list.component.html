        <!-- Data binding, is where we project values from the TS component
        file onto the html view. There are many different forms of data Binding.
    
        the     {{}}    is know as interpolation. It evaluates an expression, so you can do 
        simple operations like {{5+10}} = 15, or you can refer to variables inside of the TS 
        component file. Doing this is known as One-Way Data Binding. so this diplays the value 
        and also immediately shows changes made in the TS file of the that value. it cannot be 
        change or manipulated from the html page i.e. data from the ts file shows on the html but 
        data from the html does not show on the ts.-->
